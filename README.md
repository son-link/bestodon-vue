# Bestodon

Bestodon is a listing of Mastodon accounts, focused on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), be it software, games, Linux distributions, etc, although in the future it is likely that more listings will be added.

The source code it's available under the GNU/GPLv3 or newer license

## How to contribute

There are several ways to add an account:

* Create a fork of this project, add the desired accounts in their corresponding listings and request a pull request.
* Open a new [issue](https://github.com/son-link/bestodon/issues) with the accounts you want to add, adding also in which list you want to add them.

Please try to request to add several accounts in a single issue or pull request, this will make it easier to add them all at once, avoiding to regenerate the data. Also check that some of them are not already listed or pending to be added. Thanks

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What languages can the accounts be in?
They can be in any language, although if you are going to collaborate by adding one that is not in English or Spanish, we would be grateful if you could add a description.

### Can I add non-free or open source software accounts?

Not at the moment, although this does not affect the content, for example, if a community or Linux distribution account contains a link to how to install Nvidia's proprietary drivers, a Steam game, etc. This exception could apply to future listings that are added.

### Is it possible to add accounts from any instance?

Yes, except for reasons of force majeure, such as the instance announcing its closure, as is currently the case with mastodon.technology.

### I know of a listed account that changes instance, can I report it?

Yes. Just open a new issue reporting it, indicating the affected account, the new account, as well as a link to a toot or article on the official website, indicating the migration. This is necessary to verify the authenticity of the change.

### Can I request the deletion of any accounts?

Yes, if any of the following cases are met:

* The account, or instance, has closed and is not reported to have migrated. If it is the instance that closes, please let us know so we can check what other accounts may be affected.
* Unethical or defamatory content, either through toots posted by that account or through boosts, including links, such as hate messages or illegal downloads.
